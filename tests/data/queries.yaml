      result:
        Brian Kernighan actually wrote the first "hello, world" program as part
        of the documentation for the BCPL programming language developed by Martin Richards.
        BCPL was used while C was being developed at Bell Labs a few years before the
        publication of Kernighan and Ritchie's C book in 1972.As part of the research
        for a book I was writing about the Alice programming environment, I corresponded
        with both Prof. Kernighan at Princeton and Martin Richards at Cambridge (when
        I was teaching a seminar there in the 1990’s). They helped me to track the first
        documented use of code to print the message "Hello, World!” Brian Kernighan
        remembered writing the code for part of the I/O section of the BCPL manual.
        Martin Richards -- who seems to have a treasure trove of notes, old documents,
        etc. -- found the manual and confirmed that this was the original appearance
        of the program. The code was used for early testing of the C compiler and made
        its way into Kernighan and Ritchie's book. Later, it was one of the first programs
        used to test Bjarne Stroustrup's C++ compiler.It became a standard for new programmers
        after it appeared in Kernighan and Ritchie, whichis probably the best selling
        introduction to programming of all time.
